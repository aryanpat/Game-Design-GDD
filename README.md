# Game-Design-GDD
Created a 100-120 page document containing precise details of a game, so that a programmer can easily take the document and make a game without ever contacting me.


# What I Learned
I had decided to take this course over the summer before College hoping to get some experince into Game Design as I find it an intresting feild. Over the summer I created many mock ups, diagrams, Unity prototypes, and real life examples of my game. It was a very intresting course as I learned a lot more about what the start of Game Design is truely about, where as before I thought it was just sitting down and making a fun game without ever thinking about the years that people spend having to map everything out. This GDD was very fun to make and is not as detailed as it should be, but I still think that I did a great job on it.
